<!-- Gap, space-between, justify content, allign itens ARE ALL FLEX-BOX TERMINOLOGIES
You can only use them when displaying in flex
-->


<!-- If you display an elemet as FLEX .... it will have effects ONLY on its direct children 
    but not itself-->

<!-- Flex has  2 DIRECTIONS which are ROW and COLUMN -->
<!-- When you dispally an element as flex, its children will float horizontally BY DEFAULT which means
    the direction is ROW..

    To make it FLOAT vertically you change  the FLEX-DIRECTION to COLUMN
-->

<!-- 
    When the direction is ROW , the elements starts  from the LEFT by DEFAULT
 -->

<!-- To change  the placement of the element HORIZONTALLY you use JUSTIFY-CONTENT...this means 
to make it start from Right or center you use JUSTIFY-CONTENT: flex-end -->

<!-- In flexbox, we do not use  left, right we rather use FLEX-END and FLEX-START or CENTER -->
